- Free settling - Motion of Particles is not affected by other particles
- Hindered Settling - the settling velocity $u_h$ is a function of terminal $u_t$ settling velocity and voidage of the suspension $\varepsilon$.
- $u_h = u_t \varepsilon^n$
- The index $n$ is related to reynold's number

## Thickener
Determination of Minimum settling area is a key part in analysis od settling data and requires:
- identification of concentration at which the 

### Kynch theory
Assumptions
1. particle concentration is uniform in each layer
2. there is no wall effects
3. there is no differential settling of particles as a result of differences in shapes and size and composition of particles
4. settling velocity of particles depends only in the local concentration of particles
5. initial concentration is uniform and increases towards the bottom
6. settling velocity tends to 0 as the concentration  approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of the deposited layer 

### Relating Batch to Thickeners
1. Mass of solids in suspension = $c_0z_0A$
2. Mass of solids passing through limiting layer = $c_L(v_L+\bar v_L)At_L$
3. Since limiting layers starts at the bottom and moves upwards to meet the clear liquid interface, this mass must equal total solids present in cylinder
$c_0z_0A = c_L(v_L+\bar v_L)At_L$
$z_0\frac{c_0}{c_L} = (v_L+\bar v_L)t_L$  and $\bar v_L = \frac{z_L}{t}$
$c_l = \frac{c_0z_0}{z_l+v_Lt_L}$
$v_L = \frac{z_i-z_L}{t_L}$
$c_Lz_i = c_0z_L$


> [!question] Question
> A single batch settling test was carried out on a mine tailings slurry. The interface between the clear liquid and the suspended solids (the mud line) was measured as a function of the settling time. The intial slurry concentration was 371 kg/m^3. A 1 liter graduated cylinder with diameter of 60mm was used for the test. Calculate the settling velocity and solids concentration wrt settling velocity

### Thickener Design Aspects
1. Material Balance Solids
	$Q_u = \frac{Q_fc_f}{c_u}$
2. Material Balance on Liquids
	$Q_f(\rho_f-c_f) = Q_o(\rho -c_o)+Q_u(\rho_u-c_u)$
	$Q_f \rho_f = Q_0(\rho -c_0)+\frac{Q_fc_f}{c_u}\rho_u$
	$Q_o = Q_fc_f\left[\frac{\rho_f}{c_f}-\frac{\rho_u}{c_u}\right]\frac{1}{\rho}$
3. The difference between $\rho_{av} =\rho_f=\rho_u$ and $\rho$ is very small and for all practical purposes the densities of the underflow and the overflow can be assumed to be same.
	$v_L = \frac{Q_fc_f}{A}\left[\frac{1}{c_f}-\frac{1}{c_u}\right]\frac{\rho_{av}}{\rho}$
4. $Q_fc_f=Q_Lc_L=Q_uc_u$
5. $\frac{Q_Lc_L}{A} = \frac{v_L}{\left[\frac{1}{c_L}-\frac{1}{c_u}\right]\frac{\rho_{av}}{\rho}}$



> [!Question] Prablum
> The slurry tested in Q1 id fed to a thickener at a rate of 50 tonnes of dry solids per hour $Q_fc_f$ to produce a thickened sludge with a concentration of 600 $kg/m^3$ $c_u$. Estimate the thickener area required.
