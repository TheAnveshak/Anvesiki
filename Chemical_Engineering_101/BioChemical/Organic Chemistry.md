## Functional Groups

### 1. **C–N Functional Groups **
- **Chemistry/Biochem**:
    - **Amines** (–NH₂, –NHR, –NR₂) are weak bases; protonation state depends on pKa (~9–11).
    - **Amides** (–C(=O)–NH–) are resonance-stabilized, less basic, crucial for **peptide bonds** (protein backbone).
    - **Charged forms** (–NH₃⁺ in acidic pH) alter solubility, folding, and electrostatics of biomolecules.
    - **Peptide linkages** = thermodynamically stable, kinetically controlled → useful in drug design, biomaterials.

    - pKa shifts under different environments are exploited in **bioreactors** (e.g., enzyme immobilization).
    - Amines/amides are key in **polymer chemistry** (nylons, polyamides) — parallels between proteins and synthetic materials.

### 2. **Phosphates (Mono-, Di-, Triphosphates)**
- **Chemistry/Biochem**:
    - **Phosphate esters** (RO–PO₃²⁻) and **anhydrides** (P–O–P) form the backbone of nucleic acids and energy carriers (ATP, GTP).
    - The **phosphoanhydride bond** (~30–32 kJ/mol released on hydrolysis under standard biochemical conditions).
    
    - **High charge density** → strong hydration, influences rheology of biomolecular systems.
    - Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles act as **switches** in biochemical process control (signal transduction = "biological PLC").
    - Polyphosphates/phosphate esters are used in **biomaterials**, detergents, and as corrosion inhibitors.
### 3. **Saccharides / Disaccharides**
- **Chemistry/Biochem**:
    - Monosaccharides (glucose, fructose) = cyclic hemiacetals.
    - Disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose) are glycosidically linked sugars.
    - Hydroxyl-rich, highly hydrophilic.

    - **Feedstock chemistry**: glucose → ethanol, lactic acid, bioplastics.
    - Saccharides act as **viscosity modifiers** (hydrogen bonding → gel formation, cryoprotection).
    - Glycosylation affects **protein stability** → critical in biopharma formulations.

### 4. **DNA & RNA as Polymers**
- **Chemistry/Biochem**:
    - DNA = polymer of deoxyribonucleotides, RNA = ribonucleotides.
    - Backbone: sugar–phosphate; bases (A, T/U, G, C) stack via H-bonding and π–π interactions.
    
    - **Polymer analogy**: DNA behaves like a **polyelectrolyte** (negative charge from phosphate backbone).
    - Important in **nanotechnology** (DNA origami, programmable scaffolds).
    - Used in **biomolecular computing** (logic gates from base-pairing).
    - Mechanical properties: persistence length ~50 nm (DNA semiflexible polymer).

### 5. **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)**
- **Chemistry/Biochem**:
    - Contains two **phosphoanhydride bonds** (~30–32 kJ/mol each under standard cellular conditions).
    - Hydrolysis: ATP → ADP + Pi (ΔG°’ ~ –30.5 kJ/mol), ATP → AMP + PPi (ΔG°’ ~ –45.6 kJ/mol).

    - **Energy density** ~ 50 kJ/mol, which translates to ~0.5 MJ/kg — lower than hydrocarbons but **biologically optimal**.
    - Acts as **“energy currency”** in bioreactors/metabolic engineering (ATP balance = process bottleneck).  
    - Coupling ATP hydrolysis drives **thermodynamically uphill reactions** → concept borrowed in synthetic cycle design.

### 6. **GTP (Guanosine Triphosphate)**
- **Chemistry/Biochem**:
    - Similar to ATP in energy (ΔG°’ hydrolysis ~ –30.5 kJ/mol).
    - Specialized role in **protein synthesis (ribosome elongation)** and **signal transduction (G-proteins)**.
    
    - Considered a **molecular switch** — hydrolysis = irreversible “commit” step in control systems.
    - Useful in **synthetic biology** for designing controllable nanoscale actuators.

### 7. **C–SH (Thiols)**
- **Chemistry/Biochem**:
    - Thiols (–SH) are nucleophilic, easily oxidized to disulfides (–S–S–).
    - Important in **cysteine residues**, **glutathione** (antioxidant defense).
        
    - **Disulfide bonds** provide mechanical strength to proteins/polymers (e.g., keratin, vulcanized rubber).
    - Thiol chemistry is exploited in **surface engineering** (thiols bind strongly to Au → self-assembled monolayers).
    - In bioreactors, redox balance of –SH/–S–S– is critical for **enzyme activity** and **protein folding**.
