*Effects of pH and temperature on penicillin G Decomposition*
$$

- Penicillin: Mode of Action
	- Penicillin inhibits **peptidoglycan cross-linking** in bacterial cell walls.
	- Weakens the cell wall → bacteria burst (lysis).
	- Fermentation route for penicillin is easier than synthetic route.
- Problems in Fermentation
	1. Requirement of stable, practical growth media.
	2. Need for sterile manufacturing conditions.
	3. Large volumes of sterile air required.	    
	4. Separation process is difficult (fragile product).

- Production Fermentation
	- **Method**: Fed-batch or batch fermentation.
	- **Substrates**:
	    - Glucose
	    - Phenylacetic acid (used for side-chain precursor)
	    - Corn steep liquor - $N_2$
	    - Lactic acid
	- **Additional nitrogen sources**: Soymeal, yeast extract, inorganic ions, growth factors.
 
#### Fermenter Design & Conditions
- **Type**: Stirred tank or air-lift tank.
- **pH**: Initially 5.5–6.0; increases up to 7.5 due to NH₃ liberation and lactic acid consumption.
    - If pH > 8.0 → buffers (CaCO₃ or MgCO₃) are added.
- **Temperature**: 25–27 °C.
- **Aeration**: 0.5–1 vvm (higher at start, reduced later).
- **Agitation**: 120–150 rpm.
- **Time**: 3–5 days.
- **Anti-foam**: Edible oil (0.25%).
    
-  Recovery of Penicillin
	1. Harvest broth from fermenter.
	2. Filtration: Rotary vacuum filtration.	    
	3. Chill filtrate to 5–10 °C. # Highly reactive and is destroyed by alkali/enzymes at higher temperatures.
	4. Ion-exchange separation (anion-exchange resins).
 - Extraction of Penicillin
	1. **Penicillin sensitivity**
	    - Highly reactive; destroyed by alkali/enzymes at higher temperatures.
	2. **Acidification**
	    - Acidify the filtrate to **pH 2.0–2.5** with H₂SO₄ to convert penicillin into its acidic form.
	3. **Solvent extraction**
	    - Extract penicillin from aqueous filtrate into **butyl acetate** or **amyl acetate** at very low pH (as soon as possible, using centrifugal counter-current extractors).
	    - Distribution Coefficient = (Concentration in organic phase) / (Concentration in aqueous phase).
	4. **Purification**
	    - Pass the organic solvent phase through charcoal to remove impurities.
	    - Extract penicillin back from butyl acetate into **aqueous phosphate buffers** (pH 7.5).
	5. **Re-extraction**	    
	    - Re-acidify the aqueous fraction (pH 2–2.5 with H₂SO₄) and re-extract penicillin into fresh butyl acetate.

## Biochemical Engineering Principles

- Physical and chemical laws describe the **axioms of molecular logic of life**:
    1. Energy is required to do work.
    2. Catalytic chemical transformations are essential.
    3. Assembly of simple subunits into complex macromolecules.
    4. Complex molecules form supramolecular components, organelles, and eventually whole cells.
    5. Storage and transmission of genetic information ensures assembly of new generations from simple precursors.

#### Product recovery
Harvest broth from fermenter tank by filtration - rotary drum vacuum filtration
Chill to 5-10 $\degree C$  - penicillin is highly reactive and destroyed by alkali/enzyme at higher temperature.
acidify the filtrate to pH 2.0-2.5 with $H_2SO_4$ - to convert penicillin to acidic form
Extract penicillin from aqueous filterate into butyl acetate or amyl acetate (at this very low pH as soon as possible in centrifugal counter current extractor)

#### Partition Coefficient or Distribution coefficient
ratio of concentration of a molecule in 2 phases
