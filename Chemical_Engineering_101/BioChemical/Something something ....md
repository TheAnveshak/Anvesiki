## Glycolysis
Lactose is metabolized to lactic acid which can be catabolized (broken down into  smaller molecules ) to form acetic and propionic acids, carbon dioxides, esters and alcohols by enzymes of $\mu$organisms.
*Glycolysis is defined as the metabolic process that breaks down glucose to produce energy, which is closely related to the activation, proliferation, differentiation, survival, and function of CD4 + T cells.*
*Glycolysis occurs in both aerobic and anaerobic states.* 
*In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation leading to the net production of 32 ATP molecules.* 
*In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate converts to lactate through anaerobic glycolysis.* 
*Anaerobic respiration results in the production of 2 ATP molecules.[[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482303/#) Glucose is a hexose sugar, meaning it is a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms and six oxygen atoms.* 
*The first carbon has an attached aldehyde group, and the other five carbons have one hydroxyl group each.* 
*During glycolysis, glucose ultimately breaks down into pyruvate and energy; a total of 2 ATP is derived in the process (Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi --> 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 ATP + 2 H2O).* 
*The hydroxyl groups allow for phosphorylation. The specific form of glucose used in glycolysis is glucose 6-phosphate.*

## Lipolysis
The fat in the milk is broken down to form free fatty acids that may be then catabolized to form ketones, lactone and esters by rennet enzymes those to create the flavor in some variety of cheese.
*[Lipolysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipolysis "Learn more about Lipolysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is defined as the hydrolytic cleavage of ester bonds in [triglycerides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/triglyceride "Learn more about triglycerides from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (TGs), resulting in the generation of fatty acids (FAs) and glycerol.* 
*The two major [TG](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/triglyceride "Learn more about TG from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") pools in the body of vertebrates comprise intracellular TGs and plasma/nutritional TGs. Accordingly, this leads to the discrimination between intracellular and intravascular/gastrointestinal [lipolysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipolysis "Learn more about lipolysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), respectively.*

## Proteolysis
Proteins are gradually broken down to form peptides and amino acids by the enzymes of the coagulant, the natural milk enzymes and the enzymes of the starter bacteria and other added microorganisms.
*The addition of species results in a high level of proteolysis in these cheese.*
*The activities of the coagulant enzyme, the amount of the enzyme remaining in the curd and the amount of proteolysis in the curd and the amount of proteolysis are dependent on the amount of acid produced in the initial; stages of cheese making.*
*The pH also controls the levels of moisture which in turn effects proteolysis.*
*The final pH and the rate of pH decline determine the dissolution of colloidal calccium phosphate.*  
![[Pasted image 20250915115410.png]]
*Proteolysis is the process in which the [enzyme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/enzyme "Learn more about enzyme from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") molecule (i.e the substrate) is degraded by a protease. The sites of proteolytic attack are determined mainly by the specificity of the protease, but also involves flexible parts of the substrate which are located at the [surface](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/surface-property "Learn more about surface from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Factors which promote proteolytic activity are the temperature and partially denaturing conditions for the substrate. The effect of other conditions such as the pH and the presence of [metal ions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/metal-ion "Learn more about metal ions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are also depending on the type of protease.*

## Wine Making
- Wine making starts with crushing of grapes.
- Crushed grape juice is bottled (after filtration) & allowed to ferment with the yeast naturally present in grape skin.
- Different regions of grapes may have its own unique aroma & taste.
- The principle monoterpenes found in wine are glucosides of:
    1. Linalool
    2. Nerol
    3. Geraniol
    4. $\alpha$-terpineol
- **$\beta$-glucosidase hydrolyzes the bond between glucose and the substrate on the anomeric carbon.**
- Natural hydrolysis of glycosidically bound terpenes in the acidic conditions of wine takes years, because $\beta$-glucosidase in wine acts at conditions far from optimum.
- Grape-derived enzymes are often inactive under wine-making conditions:
    1. Low pH
    2. Presence of ethanol
    3. Phenolic compounds
    4. Sulphite salts     
- Fungal enzymes like pectinase are employed for fermentation. Also, glycosidase and glucanase are used.

To accelerate aroma development and improve product quality, **exogenous microbial enzymes** are introduced. Fungal preparations (from _Aspergillus_ and _Trichoderma_ species) provide:
- **Pectinases** – degrade pectic polysaccharides, enhancing juice extraction and clarification.   
- **β-glucosidases** – liberate terpenes by cleaving glycosidic linkages.
- **Glucanases** – hydrolyze glucans that otherwise cause filtration problems.

The design of these enzyme cocktails requires **process optimization** to balance activity under acidic, ethanol-rich environments. In biochemical engineering terms, the challenge is to shift the **enzyme activity profile** closer to the actual operating conditions of fermentation.

- **Kinetics:** Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis competes with chemical stability of glycosides; Michaelis–Menten kinetics can model release rates.
- **Process Control:** Temperature, pH buffering, and oxygen transfer are tightly regulated to prevent loss of volatile compounds.
- **Flavor Engineering:** Controlled enzyme addition enables targeted release of specific monoterpenes, leading to regional wine “terroir” profiles.
- **Downstream Processing:** Enzyme-assisted clarification reduces filtration load and improves stability of the final product.

## Vinegar Production
- Conversion of alcohol in wine to **acetic acid** by _Acetobacter_ spp.
- Other compounds in different types of vinegar:
    1. Malic, citric, succinic, lactic acids
    2. Unfermented & unfermentable sugars
    3. Oxidized alcohols
1. **Alcoholic Fermentation (Anaerobic)**
	- Carried out by yeast at **30–32 °C**.
	- By-products: glycerol, succinic acid, amyl alcohol.
2.  **Acetogenic Fermentation (Aerobic)**
	- Carried out by _Acetobacter aceti_ at **27–30 °C**.
	- **Ethanol → Acetic acid** (oxidation).
- Microorganisms Involved
	1. **Acetobacter spp.**
	    - _Acetobacter xylinum_
	    - _Acetobacter europaeus_
	    - _Acetobacter vinelandii_
	2. **Gluconobacter spp.**
	    - _Gluconobacter oxydans_

#### Industrial Methods
1. **Slow Vinegar Method (Orleans Method)**
	- Wine is left in open vats.
	- Air + bacteria from atmosphere convert ethanol -> acetic acid.
	- A small amount of vinegar is added to fresh wine (as inoculum).
2. **Trickling Generator Method**
	- Alcoholic liquid is resprinkled at the top of the tower.
	- Air enters through the middle, warms up, rises, and vents above.
	- Beechwood shavings or similar materials provide a surface for AAB (acetic acid bacteria) growth.
	*Key features:*
	- Tower has alternating **solid packings** (support for bacteria) and **liquid layers**.
	- Cooling water via intermediate heat exchanger controls temperature.
	- Sensors placed at different tower levels monitor temperature (29–35$\degree$C).
3. **Submerged Fermentation**
	- A stirred medium containing alcohol is inoculated with _Acetobacter_ or _Gluconobacter_ spp.
	- Temperature range: **24–29 $\degree$C**.
	- Bacteria grow in suspension with fine air bubbles supplied by an aerator.
	- Ethanol is oxidized to acetic acid.
	*Key points:*
	- Aeration must be vigorous (oxygen is limiting under acidic conditions).
	- Poor aeration → bacterial death.
	- Efficient cooling is necessary (fermentation is exothermic).
	- Submerged vinegar often turns turbid (high bacterial content), so filtration is required.

##  Production of Gluconic Acid
1. Raw Material - Glucose
2. Sterilization
3. Aspergillus niger and Gluconobacter oxydans
4. A. niger: secretes glucose oxidase -> converts glucose -> gluconolactone  -> spontaneously hydrolyzes to gluconic acid.
5. G. oxydans: uses membrane‐bound dehydrogenases for direct oxidation.
6. Separation and Down Stream processes.

Glutamic acid and L-Glutamic acid which is used for the preparation of monosodium glutamate is most commonly prepared by fermentation using bacteria. The most commonly used strains are Corynebacterium glutamicum and other bacterium. Other bacterial strains used for the production of L-Glutamic acid are: C acetoacidophilum, C acetoglutomicum, C alkanolyticum, C callunae, C glutamicum, C lilium, C melassecola, C thermoaminogenes (C efficiens), C herculis, Brevibacterium divaήcatum, B flavum, B immariophilum, B lactofermentum (C glutamicum), B roseum, B sacchorolyticum, B thiogenitalis, B ammoniagenes, B album, B cerinum, Microbacterium ammoniaphilum, B cerinum, M ammoniaphilium The most important fermentation ingredients used here are cassava starch, sweet corn, and glucose. In some cases preferably glucose is used for fermentation as it is relatively inexpensive and abundantly available.

## TriCarboxylic Acid Cycle
![[Pasted image 20250715072455.png]]https://onlinesciencenotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Krebs-cycle.png

The [Krebs cycle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/citric-acid-cycle "Learn more about Krebs cycle from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is a series of reactions catalyzed by seven [enzymes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/enzyme "Learn more about enzymes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in mitochondria. 
Its function is to catalyze removal of electrons from nutrients and to transfer them to [NAD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide "Learn more about NAD from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")+ and [FAD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/flavin-adenine-dinucleotide "Learn more about FAD from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), producing NADH plus H$^+$, and FADH$_2$, respectively. 
These reduced [cofactors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/cofactor "Learn more about cofactors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") exist only momentarily in their reduced (or oxidized) forms as they continually accept and then donate electrons to the [respiratory chain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/electron-transport-chain "Learn more about respiratory chain from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). 
The respiratory chain, composed of a number of [cytochromes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cytochrome "Learn more about cytochromes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), uses electrons for reduction of O2 to water. This reduction process is accompanied by or coupled with the regeneration of ATP, that is, conversion of ADP back to ATP. 
The overall effect may be summarized thus: _The Krebs cycle and respiratory chain are used for oxidizing nutrients to CO2 and for the production of energy._

The Krebs cycle, which is also called the [citric acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/citric-acid "Learn more about citric acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") cycle or the [tricarboxylic acid cycle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/tricarboxylic-acid-cycle "Learn more about tricarboxylic acid cycle from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), was discovered by Hans Krebs in 1937, at Cambridge University in Great Britain (Holmes, 1993). https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780121348366/nutritional-biochemistry

In the presence of oxygen, a molecule of CO2 and two hydrogen atoms are split from pyruvic acid, and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is formed. 
Acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetic acid in the Krebs cycle to form the six-carbon atom [citric acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/citric-acid "Learn more about citric acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). 
Citric acid is successively converted to five- and four-carbon acids as carbon dioxide molecules and hydrogen atoms are split off, and the cycle finally returns to oxaloacetic acid. 
Becker and Deamer (1991) summarized the Krebs cycle as follows:
Acetyl-CoA + 3H2O + 3NAD+ + [FAD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/flavin-adenine-dinucleotide "Learn more about FAD from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") + ADP + Pi → 2CO2 + 3NADH + 3H$^+$ + FADH2 + CoA-SH + ATP + H2O.

When the above equation is adjusted for the two cycles needed to metabolize both of the acetyl-CoA molecules derived from one molecule of glucose, the overall expression of glycolysis through pyruvate, and oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the summary equation from glucose for the Krebs cycle becomes (Becker and Deamer, 1991)
Glucose + 6H2O + 10NAD+ + 2FAD + 4ADP + 4Pi → 6CO2 + 10NADH + 10H+ + 2FADH2 + 4ATP + 4H2O

The total energy yield from one molecule of glucose (including the yields of glycolysis, pyruvate to acetyl-CoA conversion, and the Krebs cycle) is 36 ATP (see p. 96 of Raven _et al_., 1992). https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780124241626/physiology-of-woody-plants
