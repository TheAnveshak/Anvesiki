### Mechanisms
- Impact - Particle concussion by rigid force
- Compression - particle disintegration by two rigid forces
- Shear - Produced by a fluid or by particle particle interaction
- Attrition - Particles scraping against each other

Process of size reduction is the most inefficient 
as the energy is lost to to particle volume deformation , equipment deformation, frictional losses between particles - equipment , equipment-equipment, particle-paticle

**Assumptios:**
- Energy required to producea change $dL$ for a particle of size L is a simple power function of $L$:
	$\frac{dE}{dL} = -C\cdot L^n$
	**Kick's Law**:  assume n=-1,
	$E = C \cdot \ln\left(\frac{l_1}{l_2}\right)$
	$C = K_K\times f_C$
- Energy required to crush a material is proportional tot the ratio of size reduction
- Energy required to reduce size from 
- **Rittinger's Law:** assume n=-2,
	$E = K_Rf_C\left(\frac{1}{L_2}-\frac{1}{L_1}\right)$


> [!question] Question
> A material is crushed in a Blake jaw crusher such that the average size of particle is reduced from 50 mm to 10 mm with the consumption of energy of 13 kJ/kg. What would be the consumption of energy needed to crush the same material of average size 75 mm to an average size of 25mm.

**Rittinger:** $13 = C\left[\frac{1}{10}-\frac{1}{50}\right] \implies  C = 162.5kJ.mm/kg$
$E = 162.5\left[\frac{1}{25}-\frac{1}{75}\right] = 4.33kJ/kg$
**Kick:** $C = 8.1$ therefore $E = 8.87kJ/kg$

**Bond's Law:** assume $n = -\frac{3}2$
$E  = 2C\left[\frac{1}{L_2^{0.45}}-\frac{1}{L_1^{0.5}}\right]$

## Modes of Operation 
- Dry Grinding 
- Wet Grinding
	- Low power consumption
	- Higher plant capacity
	- Easy removal 
	- no dust formation
	- high wear and tear
	- drying costs
- Free Crushing
	- Material is fed at lower rate so that the product can easily escape
	- short residence time
	-
