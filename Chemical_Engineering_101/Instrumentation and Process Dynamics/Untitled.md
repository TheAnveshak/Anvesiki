## Thermistor 
Change in temperature $\alpha$ change in resistance offered.
They are semiconductors with junctions (P-N) whose resistance varies as a function of temperature.
There are 2 types
- NTC : resistance decreases with time
- PTC : resistance increases with time 
range: $T<200\degree C$
uses: thermometers, heat detectors, etc.
## ICs
ICs are integrated circuits.
They are electronic components which detect the change in temperature.
uses: Temperature sensors, pressure sensors, Humidity sensor, etc.
Consists of semiconductor transistors, which generate voltage proportional to the intended property of measurement, eg: temperature. 
## Pyrometers
Devices used to measure temperature of very hot objects.

## Strain Gauge 
converts mechanical input into electrical output.
## Differential Pressure Cell


## Liquid Level Detectors
#### Ultrasonics Level transmitter - 
- uses ultrasound , uses he time of return of ultrasound
- limitations- bubbles
#### Floor Systems,
- include a bouyant object which moves up and down and shows level of water
#### MagnetoSpecrtive Trasmittter
Uses a metal 

#### laser level transmitter 
- uses laser to measure the level by measuring the time required to for laser to return
- limitations - bubbles can refract and reflect the laser.


## Solid Level Detectors
#### Guided wave level Radar
#### Capacitance Probe 
#### Gamma Ray Absorption Method



### UV Vis Spectroscopy
Measures UV light absorption, electron transition to excited state 
This is governed by Beer Lambert's Law
$A =\varepsilon C l$ 


### FTIR - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers
Absorption of IR Radiation cause molecular vibrations, uses interferometer and fourier transform to generate a molecular fingerprint
