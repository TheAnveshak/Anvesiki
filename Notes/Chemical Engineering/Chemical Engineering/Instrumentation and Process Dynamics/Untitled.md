## Thermistor 
Change in temperature $\alpha$ change in resistance offered.
They are semiconductors with junctions (P-N) whose resistance varies as a function of temperature.
There are 2 types
- NTC : resistance decreases with time
- PTC : resistance increases with time 
range: $T<200\degree C$
uses: thermometers, heat detectors, etc.
## ICs
ICs are integrated circuits.
They are electronic components which detect the change in temperature.
uses: Temperature sensors, pressure sensors, Humidity sensor, etc.
Consists of semiconductor transistors, which generate voltage proportional to the intended property of measurement, eg: temperature. 
## Pyrometers
Devices used to measure temperature of very hot objects.

## Strain Gauge 
converts mechanical input into electrical output.
## Differential Pressure Cell
